If you're on the Free plan, you'll have to head to the dashboard to buy numbers. The Developer and
Enterprise plans both come with numbers included in the subscription. For more info, see [Pricing](https://vocode.dev/pricing).

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vocode.dev/v1/numbers/buy \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
```

```python Python
from vocode.client import Vocode

client = Vocode(environment="https://api.vocode.dev", token="<API_KEY>")
print(client.numbers.buy_number().json())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { VocodeClient } from "@vocode/vocode-api";

const vocode = new VocodeClient({
  environment: "https://api.vocode.dev",
  token: "<API_KEY>",
});

vocode.numbers.buyNumber().then((number) => {
  console.log(number);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

You'll get a response that looks like:

```json
{
  "id": "***",
  "user_id": "***",
  "number": "11234567890",
  "inbound_agent": {...}
}
```
